Fast and efficient logging:
- Generate events at specific locations in the code
- Extract parameters for later analysis
- Application specific or system wide

Trace Analysis
1. babeltrace
- Text based CTF viewer
- Default viewer for lttng view command

2. TraceCompass
-Most detailied and feature rich viewer
- Eclipse IDE integration or RCP app
- Live and remote trace views
-Control flow view, histograms, event list, trace statistics CPU/resource allocation
- Mix kernel and userspace trace analysis
